      I dont have motivation to continue without you <br/>

i need you to stay <br/>

all my bad thoughts were destroyed when i found you <br/>

trying to make me live one more day  <br/>

i don’t wanna hear you saying <br/>

that i won’t love you in any way <br/>

i just want you smiling <br/>

‘cause this love won’t have an end.
